This is a direct action sub, meaning we actively seek to achieve our goals using ChapoChat. This is not a sound board to debate antifa, this is a place to disseminate information and help organize outliers. Trolls, concern trolls and those of similar intent will be swiftly banned. This is enforced solely to prevent undermining the intention of this sub. If you believe you have been banned unfairly, you can appeal.\n\nAntifascism/ Anti-fascism, shortened to Antifa, is opposition to fascist ideologies and similar entities and policies. Antifascism began in Italy in the 1920s in opposition to the rise of Benito Mussolini, and quickly spread across Europe and then the world. For those that have difficulty in identifying what fascism is, please refer to Mussolini's own book on [The Doctrine of Fascism](http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm). There are also tenets of fascism, which are loosely outlined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism#Tenets) if you don't want to read the book.\n\nLately, in reaction to the rise of nationalism around the globe, Antifa has made a resurgence. Anyone other than fascists and apologists are welcome here, but please read the rules.\n\n### RULES\n1\\. No reactionary talking points and no fascist apologists\n\nNo reactionary talking points and no fascist apologists. This is a subreddit intended for discussion within the antifa movement, not for debating the merits of antifa. Debate and dissent is allowed, but if you just regurgitate the same uncritical anti-antifa talking points we hear daily, you will be considered spam and get banned.\n\n2\\. Harassment\n\nHarassment and bullying are NOT tolerated. This includes insults and personal attacks. We aren't here for name calling, grow up.

Use the following basic tags (feel free to use other tags if these don't cover your needs):\n  - M: male\n  - F: female\n  - T: transsexual\n  - GM/DM: gamemaster/dungeon Master\n  - NB: non-binary\n5. **Strictly 18+**.

You can think of it more like a place or a platform. Individual locations and groups in Second Life might offer some or all the features a game might have but Second Life (SL) as a whole does not.\n\nSecond Life has a wide range of ages, countries of origin, languages, interests and professions among its residents and is not limited to the typical gamer.\n\nIt offers many activities from building, landscaping and decoration over taking pictures and visiting art galleries, attending parties and live concerts, roleplay, travel by and racing a wide variety of vehicles in addition to the built-in teleports, combat both in vehicles and on foot as well as a number of adult activities. And of course you can make great friends and do all of those together.\n\nThe Second Life servers are often referred to as \"The Grid\" of if you want to distinguish the production and preview grids as Agni and Aditi.

However much of the world, particularly the global south, exists under neocolonialism whereby western powers and institutions exploit their resources and subjugate the population. Even as countries gain their independence colonialism has not stopped, it has just taken on its final form.\n\n\n𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐞𝐱𝐢𝐬𝐭?\n\nLateStageColonialism exists as a space explicitly for discussing the atrocities and continuing effects of colonialism and imperialism both in regards to the past and as they continue into the future. This space exists as a form of education and discussion because many people are truly unaware of the harms and atrocities of colonialism, and how it is still immensely damaging today. Many people think that just because today is no longer called the \"Age of Colonisation\" by western historians that colonialism no longer exists. They are unaware of the concepts of settler colonialism and neocolonialism and how they themselves may be complicit in living on stolen land. This sub is not meant as a debate sub, it is an education and discussion sub for people who will engage in good faith and want to learn. It is also meant as a guiding point for introducing people for the concept of decolonisation and what it may entail.\n\n𝚃𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚌𝚘𝚖𝚖𝚞𝚗𝚒𝚝𝚢 𝚎𝚡𝚒𝚜𝚝𝚜 𝚊𝚜 𝚊 𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚊𝚕𝚕𝚎𝚕 𝚝𝚘 𝚛𝚎𝚍𝚍𝚒𝚝.𝚌𝚘𝚖/𝚛/𝙻𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚂𝚝𝚊𝚐𝚎𝙲𝚘𝚕𝚘𝚗𝚒𝚊𝚕𝚒𝚜𝚖 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚒𝚝𝚜 𝚜𝚒𝚍𝚎𝚋𝚊𝚛 𝚑𝚊𝚜 𝚋𝚎𝚎𝚗 𝚜𝚑𝚊𝚖𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚕𝚢 𝚊𝚙𝚙𝚛𝚘𝚙𝚛𝚒𝚊𝚝𝚎𝚍 𝚏𝚛𝚘𝚖 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚜𝚞𝚋𝚛𝚎𝚍𝚍𝚒𝚝.","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":112,"community_id":150,"subscribers":163,"posts":8,"comments":29,"published":"2020-07-06T11:06:33.163704","users_active_day":3,"users_active_week":11,"users_active_month":2,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149383962,"score":-62103},{"baseurl":"exploding-heads.com","url":"https://exploding-heads.com/c/durhaminvestigation","name":"durhaminvestigation","title":"Durham Investigation","desc":"In May 2019, Attorney General William Barr tapped Connecticut’s U.S. Attorney John Durham to look into issues related to the origins of the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation. \n\nDurham is a longtime federal prosecutor in Connecticut known for leading organized crime and public corruption cases.

It often focuses on people having the freedom to do whatever they want sexually to others. In this fantasy, men/women/others might act like they don't mind being used, and the whole society treats it as no big deal. However, it's crucial to remember that this is purely a fantasy and should never be acted out without explicit consent and respect in real life.\n\n*Disclaimer: Consent is crucial for healthy sexual interactions. In the free use fantasy, it's purely fictional and should never justify non-consensual actions. Depictions of non-consensual sexual activity, including rape or assault, is condemned and has no place in the free use fantasy or real-life encounters.

It's like having a memory of something you never actually did. Being able to try it and talk about it openly, safely, and in a supportive environment, is pleasantly liberating... and somewhat addictive; you can't understand until you've tried it yourself!\" - anon.\n\nTributeMe is the home of consensual tributes. Verified ladies request tributes to their photos or videos, and other Redditors share their appreciation for all to see. Video cum tributes preferred, but all tributes welcome.\n\nPosting here is not an invitation to chat, message, cam, or hookup.\n\nTributees: Verify, then post your pic or video as a tribute request. We accept Redgif and Erome video and picture tributes. (must directly link to the pic or vid, not an album). Don’t feel bad about blocking private messages or chats.\n\nTributers: Record your tribute, upload it to Erome, Redgifs and then share the link in a comment on the post you’re tributing. (Tributes must include the pic or vid from the post.) Also include the appropriate tag in your comment: [cock pic], [cock vid], [cum pic], or [cum vid]. (If you don't have a cock, please feel free to make up your own tag.)\n\nTo reply to a tribute request, you must have actually shared a tribute. For your first comment, just include the appropriate tribute tag (rule 15), and a moderator will review it to confirm that it contains a valid tribute (rule 13).\n\nRULES\n\n1. All users must be 18 or older.\n\n2. Tribute requests must come from verified females. See verification instructions. (Trans women and couples accounts with her consent are allowed.) If you delete your verification post or photos, your verification will be revoked.\n\n3. No promoting or selling in TributeMe. Accounts that sell elsewhere are allowed, but only if they're generating sufficient tributes. \n\n4. No more than one request post per 20 hours. If you make a mistake in your post, you may delete it within the first 30 minutes and repost right away. Verification posts are exempt, so you may post again as soon as you're verified.\n\nAlbum/gallery posts are allowed, but they must be from a single photoshoot. Please do not dump a bunch of unrelated photos in a single post.\n\n5. No TributeMe reposts. Material you've posted elsewhere on Reddit is welcome.\n\n6. [Meta] posts are for general discussion of tributes. Anyone may submit a discussion text post with a [Meta] tag in the title, but requesting or offering tributes in [Meta] posts is not allowed.\n\n7. Keep it real (no significantly altered photos or videos). Cropping, color balancing, and blurring/censoring sensitive parts is allowed; changing the size or shape of body parts is not. Faking or re-using cumshots is not allowed, and her request must naturally be in the frame, not edited together as a composite.\n\n8. Be respectful. Negative, offensive, or discouraging comments are not acceptable. Degrading terms like slut or whore are only allowed if the requestor specifically asks to be degraded.\n\n9. Do not mention or ask for usernames for other services. This includes Kik, Snapchat, Skype, email, carrier pigeon, or anything other than this site. You may put other usernames in your profile, but you may not mention them in TributeMe.\n\n10. Do not mention private messages or promise anything in exchange for tributes. TributeMe is at its best when tributes and replies are public for everyone to enjoy. If you have earned reverse tribute flair, you may mention that you will reverse tribute your favorite. If you do not post a reverse tribute within a week, you will lose the flair.\n\n11. Do not ask if a requester wants a tribute or how to send a tribute. If they’re posting here, they want tributes. Record your tribute, then upload it to  Erome, or Redgifs, and share the link. If you are honestly confused, message the mods or make a [Meta] post.\n\n12. Do not attempt to identify anyone. Privacy must be respected!\n\n13. Cock or cum pics/vids must include the request and must not contain other pics/vids. Do not post a tribute of a different pic/vid.\n\n14. Do not link to a video until it finishes encoding. If Erome is taking too long, try Redgifs!\n\n15. Tag your tribute as [cock pic], [cock vid], [cum pic], or [cum vid]. Include the appropriate one in your comment. If your tribute does not fit into one of those categories, please make up your own tag and message the mods so we can approve it.\n","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":400,"community_id":446,"subscribers":55,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-13T06:50:35.873219","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":2},"time":1687150555059,"score":21340},{"baseurl":"lemmygrad.ml","url":"https://lemmygrad.ml/c/ycl_victoria","name":"ycl_victoria","title":"Young Communist League - Victoria","desc":"Semi-Official Lemmy Community for the YCL Victoria","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":75,"community_id":103,"subscribers":17,"posts":1,"comments":0,"published":"2019-10-16T05:05:21.041883","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149383823,"score":-6477},{"baseurl":"streetbikes.club","url":"https://streetbikes.club/c/honda","name":"honda","title":"Honda","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":2,"community_id":3,"subscribers":1,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-09T21:31:41.803095","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149174682,"score":286},{"baseurl":"vlemmy.net","url":"https://vlemmy.net/c/humansarespaceorcs","name":"humansarespaceorcs","title":"HumansAreSpaceOrcs","desc":"A place for all humans-are-weird related and adjacent media\nA few things \nKeep it legal\nKeep it civil\nNo bigotry\nGet weird\nHave fun","icon":"https://vlemmy.net/pictrs/image/b5e6b37d-0212-486a-9550-0b196306f24b.jpeg","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":939,"community_id":1795,"subscribers":4,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-15T23:17:43.035024","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":21},"time":1687149186263,"score":3212},{"baseurl":"fanaticus.social","url":"https://fanaticus.social/c/hawaiiwarriors","name":"hawaiiwarriors","title":"Hawaii Rainbow Warriors","desc":"A community to discuss Hawaii Rainbow Warriors athletics.\n\n**Looking for Mods!**","icon":"https://fanaticus.social/pictrs/image/82b66e33-2866-4454-b1de-3274f6b3d390.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":175,"community_id":309,"subscribers":1,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-15T01:29:50.371828","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687148812111,"score":728},{"baseurl":"lemmy.pt","url":"https://lemmy.pt/c/sao_tome_e_principe","name":"sao_tome_e_principe","title":"São Tomé e Príncipe - Geral","desc":"Espaço dedicado a São Tomé e Príncipe.","icon":"https://lemmy.pt/pictrs/image/pGNktDMduS.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":17,"community_id":18,"subscribers":4,"posts":1,"comments":0,"published":"2021-09-11T15:22:24.299618","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687150306373,"score":3172},{"baseurl":"slrpnk.net","url":"https://slrpnk.net/c/composting","name":"composting","title":"Composting","desc":"Anything related to composting, vermicomposting, bokashi, etc.\n\nAsk any question, or show us your black gold or your family of wigglers!","icon":"https://slrpnk.net/pictrs/image/ad80df39-18ea-4f5b-bcf4-943f080466ee.png","banner":"https://slrpnk.net/pictrs/image/77204aa1-17f5-4982-a775-fd3f8d41ef16.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":357,"community_id":17614,"subscribers":173,"posts":11,"comments":58,"published":"2023-06-06T19:00:46.872370","users_active_day":5,"users_active_week":21,"users_active_month":27,"users_active_half_year":27,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687153658678,"score":140649},{"baseurl":"lemmy.gtfo.social","url":"https://lemmy.gtfo.social/c/longreads","name":"longreads","title":"Longreads","desc":"### Long-form essays for curious minds\n\n**Post guidance:**\n- Articles should be longer than your average blog post. \n- Non-fiction preferred, but fiction is okay\n- Restrict commentary / personal views to the comments when posting.\n\n**Comment guidance**\n1.

Contact Awoo directly at the bottom of this sidebar.\n\n**Please stick to one of either three post types:**\n\nA standard Ask Me Anything post.\n\nA request post -- [(What is the format and why should I make a request post?)](https://www.chapo.chat/post/49288)\n\nA gauging interest post -- [(What is this?)](https://www.chapo.chat/post/49241)\n\n**What is an AmA?**\n\nAmA’s or “Ask Me Anything” began on the old internet, [originally AOL chatrooms, later followed by Slashdot](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ask-me-anything). They are crowdsourced interviews where the interviewee first makes a post describing who they are and what they do. Commenters then leave questions and can vote on other questions according to which they would like to see answered.\n\nThe interviewee can then go through and reply to the questions they find interesting, and easily see those questions the internet is dying to have the answer too. Questions will be a mixture of radical, serious and lighthearted resulting in the kind of interview you won’t get elsewhere.\n\n**What Topics Are Allowed?**\n\nAnyone can do an Ask Me Anything. The topic of the AmA must meet the rules below, and in some cases you must provide proof of the claims you are making.\nAsk Me Anything topics fall into two categories:\n\n*Something that plays a central role in your life.* The prime example of this is a person's job; posts about someone's occupation are almost always allowed. A person's topic should be something that they know thoroughly and is important to them; this gives them more to discuss and a more thorough background in the field.\n\n*A truly interesting and unique event.* An example would be \"I organised a protest against x.\" It's an activity that doesn't play a central role in someone's life but is so uncommon that many users would not have experiences of their own to relate to it.\n\n **AmAs should NOT be about:** \n\n *Mutual-Aid and Crowd Funding* - AmA submitters that include any aid or funding campaign must be eligible for an AmA without the campaign for it to be allowed. Additionally, the focus of the AmA must not be the campaign -- those posts would be more appropriate in the mutual-aid community.\nPosts about suicide.\n\n **Other Restrictions:** \n\nGiveaways are not permitted on AmA. Contests and giveaways already running on a third party site prior to the AmA are acceptable\n\n**Proof**\n\nProof in the case of public figures or orgs may be a social media post on an official account. For other topics it may be a proof image. This does not always have to be included in the post at the time of posting and it may be discussed with the moderators and provided privately. We will ALWAYS respect your complete privacy.\n","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":56,"community_id":58,"subscribers":19344,"posts":221,"comments":8474,"published":"2020-11-08T20:28:13.543989","users_active_day":2,"users_active_week":2,"users_active_month":22,"users_active_half_year":136},"time":1687149307502,"score":58032},{"baseurl":"lemmings.online","url":"https://lemmings.online/c/leuven","name":"leuven","title":"Leuven","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":34,"community_id":35,"subscribers":1,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-14T15:11:41.962793","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687149171684,"score":243},{"baseurl":"fanaticus.social","url":"https://fanaticus.social/c/coastalchanticleers","name":"coastalchanticleers","title":"Coastal Carolina Chanticleers","desc":"A community to discuss Coastal Carolina Chanticleers athletics.\n\n**Looking for Mods!**","icon":"https://fanaticus.social/pictrs/image/72acf81d-6bc6-446f-95ca-7995a2a86332.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":160,"community_id":292,"subscribers":0,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-15T00:40:10.119588","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687148812115,"score":0},{"baseurl":"feddit.pl","url":"https://feddit.pl/c/polska","name":"polska","title":"/r/polska","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1,"community_id":2,"subscribers":3,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-13T20:43:09.529801","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0},"time":1687149278847,"score":453},{"baseurl":"lemmygrad.ml","url":"https://lemmygrad.ml/c/neurodiversimemes","name":"neurodiversimemes","title":"Neurodiversimemes","desc":"Memes that could be relatable to some neurodivergent people.\n\nRules:\n- Memes\n- Sitewide rules","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1015,"community_id":43490,"subscribers":7,"posts":1,"comments":4,"published":"2023-05-21T17:09:37.678989","users_active_day":2,"users_active_week":4,"users_active_month":4,"users_active_half_year":4,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149383638,"score":-2667},{"baseurl":"lemmy.ca","url":"https://lemmy.ca/c/kingstonontario","name":"kingstonontario","title":"KingstonOntario","desc":"old.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario lives on now on lemmy.ca","icon":"https://lemmy.ca/pictrs/image/3d13aeaa-9a9a-4cb6-8ec6-33cb5ba1db65.png","banner":"https://lemmy.ca/pictrs/image/bd11776a-c497-4e2e-9085-7173d7a8f58b.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1410,"community_id":35382,"subscribers":5,"posts":1,"comments":1,"published":"2023-06-14T12:35:18.452873","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":33},"time":1687149369073,"score":4215},{"baseurl":"feddit.de","url":"https://feddit.de/c/darmstadt","name":"darmstadt","title":"Darmstadt","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":978,"community_id":45366,"subscribers":17,"posts":3,"comments":1,"published":"2023-06-04T09:49:02.747997","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":2,"users_active_half_year":2,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687153678679,"score":14807},{"baseurl":"lemm.ee","url":"https://lemm.ee/c/olympia","name":"olympia","title":"Olympia WA","desc":"A community to discuss Olympia, WA","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1652,"community_id":4880,"subscribers":2,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-18T04:20:22.623540","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":19,"hot_rank_updated":"2023-06-19T04:30:40.540547"},"time":1687149189287,"score":1658},{"baseurl":"sffa.community","url":"https://sffa.community/c/cosmere","name":"cosmere","title":"Cosmere","desc":"1.

But I am curious about that kelp farming thing now that you mentioned it.\n\nLow effort / spam videos might be removed, especially weeb content.\n\nThere is a [cytube](https://live.hexbear.net/c/movies) that you can paste videos into and watch with whoever happens to be around. It's open submission unless there's something important to commandeer it with at the time.\n\nA weekly watch party happens every Saturday (Sunday down under), with video nominations Saturday-Monday, voting Monday-Thursday. See the pin for whatever stage it's currently in.","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":36,"community_id":38,"subscribers":21923,"posts":11843,"comments":42721,"published":"2020-08-28T23:30:54.856264","users_active_day":23,"users_active_week":238,"users_active_month":525,"users_active_half_year":1127},"time":1687149307437,"score":65769},{"baseurl":"stars.leemoon.network","url":"https://stars.leemoon.network/c/citrinya","name":"citrinya","title":"🛡️ Цитриния 🍋 ","desc":"[**Цитриния**](https://leemoon.network/minetest.html) - это анархокоммуна в кубическом воксель-мире, город на спавне самого сервера, названного в её честь. \n\n[**🗺️OpenStreetBlock**](https://openstreetblock.leemoon.network/)\n\nАдрес: mt.leemoon.network:30000 \n**перед регистрацией свяжитесь с [администраторкой](https://lamp.leemoon.network/@sarahquartz)**\n\n[**🎙️Jitsi-комната**](https://jitsi.inex.rocks/citrineplayers) для аудио-общения\n\n[**Скачать Minetest**](https://minetest.net/downloads/)\n\n::: spoiler 📝🍋 Правила кислосладкого этикета, тезис/антитезис:\n- Быть вежливыми\n- Не быть мудаками\n- Строить своё\n- Не ломать чужое\n- Жить спокойно самим (только если вам не захотелось в отвязное приключение:)\n- Не мешать жить другим (только если вы не взаимно согласовали зрелищную дуэль:)\n>\"Относись к другим людям так, как хочешь, чтобы они относились к тебе\"\n:::","icon":"https://stars.leemoon.network/pictrs/image/9ed59bab-dea4-4d59-bd45-751263d65c0e.png","banner":"https://stars.leemoon.network/pictrs/image/c3f8c220-74ee-4fdd-8993-155c3eb8f3d1.webp","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":41,"community_id":68,"subscribers":6,"posts":1,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-17T23:21:56.546978","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":19},"time":1687149013399,"score":3288},{"baseurl":"discuss.tchncs.de","url":"https://discuss.tchncs.de/c/sounders","name":"sounders","title":"Seattle Sounders FC","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":274,"community_id":854,"subscribers":3,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-11T00:19:49.844114","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687148815113,"score":2487},{"baseurl":"sh.itjust.works","url":"https://sh.itjust.works/c/sewing","name":"sewing","title":"Sewing","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":717,"community_id":1480,"subscribers":81,"posts":4,"comments":4,"published":"2023-06-11T04:59:51.572245","users_active_day":2,"users_active_week":5,"users_active_month":5,"users_active_half_year":5,"hot_rank":10},"time":1687149210560,"score":68931},{"baseurl":"lemmy.helvetet.eu","url":"https://lemmy.helvetet.eu/c/folkmetal","name":"folkmetal","title":"Folk Metal","desc":"Also check out other metal music communities:\n- [!metal@lemmy.helvetet.eu](https://lemmy.helvetet.eu/c/metal) \n- [!symphonicmetal@lemmy.helvetet.eu](https://lemmy.helvetet.eu/c/symphonicmetal) \n- [!deathcore@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/deathcore)\n- [!deathmetal@lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/deathmetal)","icon":"https://lemmy.helvetet.eu/pictrs/image/b818ff84-6fd3-448c-9834-39474caa65ed.jpeg","banner":"https://lemmy.helvetet.eu/pictrs/image/ef5efc88-c8fa-4f0c-bf74-854b382f7bc3.png","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":458,"community_id":7064,"subscribers":8,"posts":2,"comments":3,"published":"2023-06-10T22:43:08.148020","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":2,"users_active_month":2,"users_active_half_year":2,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687149156407,"score":656},{"baseurl":"exploding-heads.com","url":"https://exploding-heads.com/c/albania","name":"albania","title":"Albania","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":399,"community_id":2342,"subscribers":6,"posts":3,"comments":6,"published":"2022-11-18T12:58:14.136930","users_active_day":4,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":4,"users_active_half_year":4},"time":1687149135165,"score":870},{"baseurl":"mtgzone.com","url":"https://mtgzone.com/c/vintage","name":"vintage","title":"Vintage","desc":"**Vintage format (Type 1) discussion.**\n\nPlay your moxen here!

No spam, self-promotion or clickbait\nPlease no ads for your youtube/twitch channel or streams here.

Just because a 2h video has a hilarious bug in it doesn't mean you should post the whole video. Caps lock clickbait titles are especially criminal.

Driven by an insatiable appetite for ever greater profits regardless of social cost, capitalism is on a collision course with the people of the world and the planet itself. Imperialist war; deepening unemployment and poverty; deteriorating health care, housing and education; racism; discrimination and violence based on gender and sexual orientation; environmental destruction—all are inevitable products of the capitalist system itself.\n\nFor the great majority of people in the world, including tens of millions of workers in the United States, conditions of life and work are worsening. There is no prospect that this situation can or will be turned around under the existing system.\n\nThe idea that the capitalists’ grip on society and their increasingly repressive state can be abolished through any means other than a revolutionary overturn is an illusion. Equally unrealistic are reformist hopes for a “kinder, gentler” capitalism, or solutions based on economic decentralization or small group autonomy. Meeting the needs of the more than 6.5 billion people who inhabit the planet today is impossible without large-scale agriculture and industry and economic planning.\n\nThe fundamental problems confronting humanity today flow from the reality that most of the world’s productive wealth—the product of socialized labor and nature—is privately owned and controlled by a tiny minority. This minority decides what will be produced and what will not. Its decisions are based on making profits rather than meeting human needs.\n\nThere are really only two choices for humanity today—an increasingly destructive capitalism, or socialism.","icon":"https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/29027635-d0fc-4340-bd60-b0f218931c69.png","banner":"https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/2e34cf64-d3eb-4154-821d-e4ea83b955ac.png","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":626,"community_id":20867,"subscribers":67,"posts":33,"comments":5,"published":"2022-03-23T22:08:03.581142","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":4,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149383935,"score":-25527},{"baseurl":"zapad.nstr.no","url":"https://zapad.nstr.no/c/pictures","name":"pictures","title":"pictures","desc":"Share photos and pictures you’ve made.

Variations of its use are seen today in the banyas of Russia, the hararas of Turkey, the sweat lodges of the American Indians, and, most famously, the saunas of Finland.\n\nSauna use, sometimes referred to as “sauna bathing,” is characterized by passive exposure to extreme heat. This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia – an increase in the body’s core temperature – that induces a thermoregulatory response involving hormonal, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future stressors. In recent decades, sauna use has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health.","icon":"https://exploding-heads.com/pictrs/image/d8fc61e8-a802-4378-8dff-c29b05986548.jpeg","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":173,"community_id":324,"subscribers":9,"posts":43,"comments":4,"published":"2022-05-03T21:49:12.521310","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1},"time":1687149135280,"score":1305},{"baseurl":"infosec.pub","url":"https://infosec.pub/c/los_angeles","name":"los_angeles","title":"Los Angeles","desc":"Lemmy instance for Los Angeles natives and visitors alike!!

This subcom is for news, general information, memes, and discussion related to CPUSA, working class organization and solidarity, and the broader struggle against all forms of oppression and exploitation. This is a space for socialists, communists, and leftists. Please read the rules before posting. While run and moderated by members of CPUSA, this subcom is not an official Party platform.\n\nc/CPUSA Rules\n\n1. No Bigotry, Hate Speech, Or Oppressive Language\n\nNo bullying, hate speech, slurs, or oppressive language of any kind. No excessive use of vulgar, violent, sexist, or crude language. No imperialist, settler-colonial, police/prison, rape, or conservative, fascist or otherwise reactionary apologia.\n\nFirst offense will result in editing of post/comment & warning - learn from your mistake. Repeat offenses or failure to properly edit post/comment will result in permanent ban.\n\n2. Be Respectful & Comradely\n\nRefrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Criticisms must be made in a principled manner.\n\nWhile spirited debate is a good thing, parroting and dissemination of anti-communist propaganda and falsehoods will not be tolerated.\n\nPosts and comments must be in good-faith and of high quality. Trolls will be banned on sight.\n\n3. No Promotion Or Campaigning For Non-Party Candidates\n\nCPUSA does not endorse non-Party candidates.\n\nNews regarding politics & political campaigns may be posted in the event that it’s presented from a communist/socialist perspective and is not obvious promotion or campaigning. Discussions and honest, good-faith questions are welcome.\n\nFirst offenses will result in removals & warnings, but repeat offenses will result in bans.\n\n4. No Systematic Crossposts Or Excessive Self-Promotion\n\nWhile we understand crossposts as a tool to both credit original posts and discover smaller & newer leftist/socialist/communist communities, this is a space for CPUSA members, not an advertising subcom.\n\nExcessive, needless crossposts to your own subcoms, screenshots of your own twitter posts, etc., in addition to a lack of interaction with the subcom, may result in removals or bans.\n\nPlease double check before creating duplicate posts (reposts). Reposts will be removed.\n\n5. Abide By All Official Lemmy Rules\n\nAdditionally, the mods reserve the right to ban users (as well as remove, lock, or otherwise moderate any content on the subcom) for reasons not listed above if we consider it necessary to do so.\n\nMission:\n\nc/CPUSA, being moderated and led by members of the Communist Party USA, is not an official outlet of the Party. It does, however, raise as its purpose the spreading of information and resources as it relates to CPUSA and its work. We do not speak for the Party and our opinions are our own, but we shall adhere to the Party Program at all times and always seek to further the interests of the Party.\n\nCPUSA recruitment materials may be shared openly, but it shall not be the primary purpose of c/CPUSA to recruit for the Party. If individuals are interested in our Party then we shall share information with them and attest to why we are members and why we believe others should join. At no point shall we attempt to compete with other parties or disparage them.\n\nIt shall be the primary purpose of c/CPUSA to share information with both current Party members, prospective members, and any and all fellow travelers or casual Lemmy users who wish to explore our Party and/or learn about Marxism and Marxism-Leninism in a friendly and positive environment, away from sectarianism and “woke” left-wing cannibalism. We shall not partake in or tolerate feuding or drama that is not ultimately productive for real-world change.\n\nThe ultimate goal of c/CPUSA is to encourage all people, regardless of tendency or party affiliation, to join a union or worker’s assembly and to get organized in the work of overturning capitalism. This shall take different forms for different people, and we welcome all. For those who are members and prospective members, this shall likewise extend to serving as an additional resource for them in becoming more involved with the Party.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe primary method by which we shall pursue these goals is by being active in the subcom itself. So long as members follow the rules as above, their activities shall be allowed. Crossposting articles, whether from PW, CPUSA.org, or other news outlets must either be authorized or be within the rules outlined by other subcoms. Without authorization, articles and information should be posted and not cross-posted.\n\nAdvertising on other subcoms on behalf of c/CPUSA without the permission of the Moderators is not a permissible method in pursuing our goals.

Instead, dickless is for people with dicks (ironic, isn't it). If you have a penis, but prefer to have sex with your butt, your nipples, your mouth, or some other way, you're in the right place. Related kinks and fetishes like chastity, bdsm, etc. are welcome.\n\nRules:\n- No illegal or harmful content\n- Don't be a dick\n- All posts must be tagged as NSFW\n- No Jerking!\n\n**Currently looking for more moderators**-\n\n\n\n**What is Dickless?**\n\nDickless is a community for content and discussion by and about people who have a dick, and choose not to use it. Not people who don't have sex, but people that use their other erogenous zones for sex instead. Wether you prefer to use your mouth, your nipples, or your backdoor, your welcome here!\n\n**Why does this community exist?**\n\nThere are many communities on the internet for people who are Anal Only, but they're either dominantly cis women, or attached to some related kink (chastity, sissy, BDSM). In all my searching, I couldn't find one that was primarily intended for people born with penises, so I'm making one!\n\n**Why would anyone not use their dick?**\n\nBecause there's more to sex than that! Some people find that their other ergonous zones can be more stimulating or rewarding than their genitals. Communities for people who are Anal Only exist, usual for cis women that prefer anal sex, so it's not too far fetched to think that are are some penis-havers that feel the same! Whether it's just a fetish, or how your body or brain is wired, you don't have to use your dick if you don't want to.\n\n\n**You've got my attention...**\n\nIf you're interested, subscribe! If you see something you like, upvote and comment! If you have a question, or some content to post, go ahead!

If you have to ask yourself 'hmm, is this the sort of meme I should be posting', the answer is definitely 'no'.\n\n2. No Bigotry or Bullying\n\nDankmemes does not tolerate bullying or bigotry. All are welcome here, no matter their race, gender, religion, political beliefs, country of origin, sexuality, fursona, or gaming choices.\n\nPlease stay civil within comment threads. Avoid personal attacks, and do not weaponize a person's user history.\n\nYes, ironic death threats are still death threats.\n\nIf you have to ask yourself 'hmm is this the sort of thing I should be saying?', the answer is 'no'. So don't say it.\n\n3. Don't be a dick!\n\nDon't be a dick! (yes, posting spoilers counts as being a dick).\n\nTrolling (including downvote trolling) is not allowed in dankmemes, and posting content purely to get a reaction will not be tolerated.\n\nYou do not need to participate in this community, you are free to leave if you hate it.\n\n4. Censor any and all personal information from posts and comments\n\nCensor any and all personal information from posts and comments, or it will be removed. Real or fake! Yours or others! Just don't do it.\n\nThis includes non-verified twitter handles, reddit usernames that aren't watermarks, and all other social media!\n\nIf it doesn't start with a 'u/' (promptly followed by your reddit username), it will get yote!\n5. No spam, outside links, or videos.\n\ndankmemes is strictly for your original memes. This is not a platform to advertise your social media network or community. Do not link to any discord servers. And do not post videos.\n\nNo queue flooding - Limit yourself to 5 posts per day, preferably spaced out. Exceeding this number may result in a ban.\n\nIf you need some help to pass the time, try checking out our sister subs for more dankmemes fun: r/Dankexchange & r/Meme_Battles\n\n6. No Metabaiting\n\nDo not ask for upvotes, awards, or talk about your cakeday.\n\n7. No brigading\n\nDo not participate in bad faith, Do not post links elsewhere directing people to interfere with this community. \"Raids\" will result in bans. Keep dankmemes in dankmemes, do not bother other communities.\n\n8. Keep it dank!\n\nKeep it dank! This sub is for humor (and the dankest of memes)!\n\nMods may use discretion when removing memes that are not relevant or current to preserve the quality of the sub. Poor picture quality and construction (illegible text, bad cropping, etc) may also lead to a post being removed. User feedback (reports, etc) may also be a factor\n\n9. Mark NSFW and spoilers appropriately\n\nIf your post is NSFW, mark it as NSFW.\n\nIf your post contains spoilers, mark it as spoilers.\n\nIf you have to ask yourself 'hmm is this nsfw and/or spoilers', the answer is 'yes'.\n10. NO REEEEEEE-POSTS!\nIf you didn't make the meme yourself, don't post it.\n\nDo not try to game the system or post deleted content without permission. Repost chains are also not permitted. And don't encourage reposting.\n\nWe don't care if you have 'pErMiSsIoN', or if you give 'cReDiT'. It's still reposting.\n\nOn a related note, here's a foolproof way to work out if your post is a repost or not: Ask yourself 'hmm, did I make this meme?'. If the answer to that question is 'no', it's a repost. So don't post it.\n11. No shitposting\n\nWe have high-ish standards here! Low-effort memes may be removed.\n\nThis includes, but is not limited to:\n\n    Reactions to text/headlines/social media\n\n    Non-original memes (copying a concept that someone else used, or containing no original material)\n\n    Sign images (Sign templates with only text overlays)\n\n    Comment baiting posts (ama, comment and I'll rate, fuck zodiac signs, which side are you on and any other post where users are asked to respond)\n\n12. Format your meme correctly. No posts where the title is the meme caption!\n\nPosts must be formatted correctly. No posts where the title is the meme caption. The caption must be in the meme image, not in the submission title.\n\nContent that is not a meme at all or that does not make sense will be removed, including photos, screenshots, and blank templates. Properly crop your memes, folks.\n\nFanart is still appreciated (who knows? if it's good enough, maybe we might consider it worthy enough to belong in a museum...)\n13. No agenda posting!\n\ndankmemes is for dank memes. It’s not a political campaign ground. Absurd memes about politicians are cool, but we are not interested in your activism, or any agenda you’re bandwagoning for a country/cause, on any platform.\n\nThis is not the place for protest petitioning.\n\nNo cesspools: If a post creates a toxic environment in the comments it may be removed. Slur chains, reactionary bait, etc.\n\nPlease keep political comments brief and civil, this not a place for lectures.\n\n14. Don't be a critic\n\nDo not heckle or be rude to each other. Criticism should either be constructive, or not given at all.\n\nPlease show OP respect.\n\nThere is no reason to announce that you hate a post. Downvotes are there for that.

This is not a hentai community, there's plenty of those on here. Rather, it's for erotic or pornographic art in a non-cartoon style, whether new or old (historical paintings are welcome too). Hentai need not be disqualified, but look at what's already in here and use your best judgement.\n\n> Erotic artwork is a diverse category of visual arts that includes any artistic creation meant to elicit erotic pleasure, typically representing human nakedness as well as sexual behavior. Sexual artwork may be discovered in practically every visual media, such as sketches, engravings, movies, erotic paintings, photography, and sculptural works. \n\n\n::: spoiler Just a heads up\nYou need to create an account or enable NSFW in your current account to view the content in this community\n:::\n\n# Guide to Tags\n\n**All posts must be tagged.**\n\n[Soft] - No penetration, no / minimal bodily fluids\n\n[Hard] - Any penetration or excessive bodily fluids\n\n[Fetish] - Hopefully self-explanatory, but a non-exhaustive list: BDSM, pee, bizarre bodily proportions (disproportionate breasts, penises, etc.), futa, etc. Most of these are rare in content that would be found in this sub, but if it otherwise fits, it sits, so long as it's tagged appropriately.\n\nHistorical art is not exempt from the tagging rules. E.g. [The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tako_to_ama_retouched.jpg) would fall under [Fetish], regardless of its historical nature.\n\n# Rules\n\nFollow instance-wide rules and:\n\n- Try to use the actual title of a piece for the post title, if it exists / you can find it.\n- As mentioned above, stick to erotic art which is not in a cartoon style, !hentai, !rule34 and their ilk exist, so please help keep this community focused.\n- Yes, photography is an art form, it's even mentioned in the quoted blurb, no it is not welcome here, there's plenty of communities for that. The same applies for film.\n- No gore, vore, scat or anything that would be considered very extreme.\n- Corollary to the above rule: Rape is allowed, as to disallow it would also disallow a lot of historical paintings which outright hang in museums. **However,** the artistic merit of such will be judged much more harshly, in a manner proportionate to how graphic it is. Tag-wise, any non-historical examples likely fall under [Fetish], though feel free to ping a mod and ask for reclassification if you believe it's fine under [Hard].\n- No low effort posts (low quality images/videos, black bars, etc.)\n- No aI generated content. If you want to post anything AI generated use the relevant communities, such as !aigen\n- All posts must be tagged\n- Loli / shota (that is, depictions of apparently underaged subjects, whether) is banned, as per instance rules. Yes, it can be hard to tell, what one person considers loli / shota another might just consider petite, use your best judgement, and the mods will use theirs. Don't sweat it if a post gets removed, but if you're starting to become a problem, you'll get DMed / temp-banned before you get permed.\n\nif possible please also provide the sauce (link to artist etc) in the body of your post.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or ideas for the community please feel free to message @securitas.\n","icon":"https://lemmynsfw.com/pictrs/image/a9f2bf38-a334-4ae0-ab3b-3e08f9690461.jpeg","banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":793,"community_id":1181,"subscribers":175,"posts":10,"comments":3,"published":"2023-06-15T21:31:48.955483","users_active_day":2,"users_active_week":4,"users_active_month":4,"users_active_half_year":4,"hot_rank":8},"time":1687150554678,"score":67900},{"baseurl":"feddit.nl","url":"https://feddit.nl/c/rotterdam","name":"rotterdam","title":"Rotterdam","desc":"A community for everyone who is interested in Rotterdam.","icon":"https://feddit.nl/pictrs/image/1f3e7b8e-b6e4-463f-b2ac-d0c19c976a72.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":382,"community_id":743,"subscribers":16,"posts":2,"comments":2,"published":"2023-06-12T14:45:41.578562","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":3,"users_active_month":3,"users_active_half_year":3,"hot_rank":3},"time":1687149152548,"score":12800},{"baseurl":"sh.itjust.works","url":"https://sh.itjust.works/c/calvinandhobbes","name":"calvinandhobbes","title":"Calvin and Hobbes","desc":"Post your favorite calvin and hobbes comics! \nRules:\nOnly post unmodified whole strips, or unmodified parts of a strip if they make sense on their own.

No non-marxists\n\nThis subreddit is here to facilitate discussion between marxists.\n\nThere are other  communities aimed at helping along new communists. This community isn't here to convert naysayers to marxism.\n\nIf you are a member of the police, armed forces, or any other part of the repressive state apparatus of capitalist nations, you will be banned.\n\n2. No oppressive language\n\nDo not attempt to justify your use of oppressive language.\n\nDoing this will almost assuredly result in a ban. Accept the criticism in a principled manner, edit your post or comment accordingly, and move on, learning from your mistake.\n\nWe believe that speech, like everything else, has a class character, and that some speech can be oppressive. This is why speech that is patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, ableist, or otherwise oppressive is banned.\n\nTERF is not a slur.\n\n3. No low quality or off-topic posts\n\nPosts that are low-effort or otherwise irrelevant will be removed.\n\nThis is not a place to engage in meta-drama or discuss random reactionaries on lemmy or anywhere else.\n\nThis includes memes and circlejerking.\n\nThis includes most images, such as random books or memorabilia you found.\n\nWe ask that amerikan posters refrain from posting about US bourgeois politics. The rest of the world really doesn’t care that much.\n\n4. No basic questions about marxism\n\nPosts asking entry-level questions will be removed.\n\nQuestions like “What is Maoism?” or “Why do Stalinists believe what they do?” will be removed, as they are not the focus on this forum. \n\n5. No sectarianism\n\nMarxists of all tendencies are welcome here.\n\nRefrain from sectarianism, defined here as unprincipled criticism. Posts trash-talking a certain tendency or marxist figure will be removed. Circlejerking, throwing insults around, and other pettiness is unacceptable.\n\nIf criticisms must be made, make them in a principled manner, applying Marxist analysis.\n\nThe goal of this subreddit is the accretion of theory and knowledge and the promotion of quality discussion and criticism.\n\nCheck out [ProleWiki](https://prolewiki.org) for a communist wikipedia.\n\n![bottombanner](https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/lr3uk6.png?format=webp&thumbnail=500)\n","icon":"https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/CM5RpRRaXY.png","banner":"https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/Ncklv5BNCh.png","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1,"community_id":2,"subscribers":8328,"posts":2574,"comments":9988,"published":"2019-08-16T23:13:27.017010","users_active_day":16,"users_active_week":65,"users_active_month":127,"users_active_half_year":260,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149383430,"score":-3172968},{"baseurl":"sh.itjust.works","url":"https://sh.itjust.works/c/unrealengine","name":"unrealengine","title":"UnrealEngine","desc":"Community for Unreal Engine Developers!

We may start filtering out posts that do not include this in the near future.\n\nFor the most part, posters on this subreddit do not need to be verified. That said, there are now several ways that users can get verified:\n\n- A user may post (or pm the mods) a gonewild-style verification picture, and we will grant you the flair of your choice.\n- A person may message the mod team on another user's behalf telling us that someone is fun to play with (either giving or receiving commands), and we will give that person an appropriate flair after confirming that that uses wants it.\n- Last, if you make an extreme post that we think might be fake we reserve the right to ask you to verify. If you do not, we might remove your post/and or ban you... This primarily affects \"destroy my life\" and \"deny me forever\" posts.\nAfter you post\n\nYour post constitutes a promise that you will follow instructions to the letter (or find the closest possible substitute). Sessions should respect your limits, so please communicate them clearly both before and during.\n\nNitty-Gritty\n\n- This is NOT a version of GW. Some people may be willing to post pictures, some may not. Please no comments that simply say, \"show us your tits.\" Take that shit elsewhere.\n- Respect all posters.

All genders and presentations welcome.\n\n**RULES**\n\n1) Original content (OC) only. Only post your own work. You must be the photographer! It's fine if you're also the model. \n\n- 1a) Be prepared to prove what you post is your own, like the RAW (or original JPG) file with intact EXIF or a psd with your layers visible.\n\n- 1b) No screencaps or other low-effort posts, only composed, deliberate photographs. If you're posting a still from your webcam, it better be really really damn good. \n\n2) Photography only. No AI art! No work that may have started as a photograph but is now mostly AI art! Images that rely heavily on AI backgrounds (like greenscreen images) may be allowed on a case-by-case basis, but are mostly discouraged. Use of AI tools like AI skin smoothing or AI upscaling is allowed unless it's extreme.\n\n- 2a) Composites are fine if the elements of the composite are all your own work. \n\n3)  No advertising! That means no links to OF/Patreon/Fansly/smugmug or any other site in which anyone collects money for anything. Don't put it in your post and not in the comments to your post. If you have a link in your profile, that's fine. \n\n- 3a) If you have some kind of nonprofit solicitation, like a charity drive for the Free Speech Coalition or something, check with mods first.\n\n4) Flag your posts NSFW unless they aren't.\n\n\n5) Text posts are fine as long as they are on-topic and tagged [Text].\n\n- 5a) Use [Gallery] for any post that contains more than one or two images. Gallery posts are generally discouraged and if you do it too often we'll ask you to stop. Links in a comment to galleries hosted elsewhere are fine.\n\n\n6) Requred imagepost level tags: [Lewd], [Nude], [Explicit], [Hardcore]\n\n\n- 6a) [Nude] includes toplessness (visible nipples) **OF ANY GENDER.** The mods don't want to be in the business of figuring out what counts as NSFW nipples and what doesn't, so any visible nipple **OF ANY GENDER** should be flagged [Nude].\n\n\n- 6b) [Explicit] includes any open leg, any buttholes on display, and any erect penises.\n\n\n- 6c) [Hardcore] includes any sexual activity of any kind, including masturbation, ejaculation, or any explicit sexual activity between two or more people.\n\n\n- 6d) When in doubt, go for the higher level. If posting multiple images of multiple levels, tag with the highest level.\n\n7) **No images of anyone <18 years old of any kind**, even if they happen to be SFW and completely innocent in nature. None. **No discussions of such images** either. If there's one rule that will get you immediately shitcanned if you break it, it's this one. \n\n- 7a) Any posts containing unconventional fetishes (including but not limited to scat, hot lunch, blood, violent play, CNC, vore) must be tagged in the post title. If in doubt, tag it.\n\n- 7b) Furry stuff is okay, I guess, as long as it conforms with all the other rules. No bestiality content. \n\n8) Be nice. If you can't be nice, keep it to yourself.\n\n- 8a) No body shaming of any kind, no homophobia, transphobia, kink shaming, or nazi shit. If there are two rules that will get you immediately shitcanned if you break them, it's 7) and this one. Mods are woke and queer and angry. \n\n9) If you want critiques or need technical help, indicate that in your post subject and then post any relevant information in a top-level comment. This includes stuff like your camera, exposure, aperture, iso, lighting, and the intent of your image.\n\n- 9a) A request for a critique is not a license to be a dbag. Keep your criticism constructive, please. Do not offer unsolicited critiques. If you really really really feel like you have something critical to say, you can ask if someone wants a critique in a post comment. No reply means no.\n\n- 9b) If you ask for a critique and you get one, please take the time to reply and thank the person for their time. Also, don't get salty about critiques you don't like. You literally asked for it.

Finally, please obey all subreddit rules when submitting an edit!\n\n---\n\n# Rules:\n\n**1. We are not ironically antifascists**. We are very much serious, and we expect you to be as well if you participate here. We’re here to hurt rockyeet and his ideology, and we won’t ask you to pull your punches. (And if you don’t like antifa, we really don’t care).\n\n**2. No in-fighting.** We’re here to fight fascism, not each other. The only exception are fascists and anything adjacent to fascism. Go wild on them and report. This also means we expect you to keep discussion somewhat civil -- don't go overboard with insults when you're debating.\n\n**3. No linking to stonetoss' website or social media.** This applies to comments and submissions and no exceptions will be made. Bypassing the filter with creative spelling will get you permanently banned.\n\n**4. Edit the credits in all comics.** Your edit must have credits that clearly identify it as antifa. The easy one is “Stonetoss is a nazi”. We're lenient on this one -- keep in mind the point is to avoid having our edits shared by fascists.\n\n**5. How to provide the oregano.** If you want to explain the original comic (before the edit), please write a transcript. We don't allow the posting of original comics even with the credits removed.\n\n**6. We only allow edits from Stonetoss**, but also **original comics if you're the author** and were inspired by the subreddit ([read more here](https://www.reddit.com/r/antifastonetoss/comments/fujhsx/the_current_state_of_original_comics_on_the_sub/)). If you want to submit something else, please ask in modmail first.\n\n**7. No bigotry, trolling or fascism.** This applies to your comment history as well. No racism, sexism, ableism, classism, anti-LGBT discrimination, or any other form of bigotry. No support of fascism either. The comfort level of readers who experience these forms of bigotry takes priority in this subreddit over your right to speak freely.\n\n**8. Edits must be in support of things stonetoss hates**. Conversely, don't make edits that agree with stonetoss. Stonetoss hates many things (the LGBT, the left, religion, vegans, minorities...) so there's many topics to pick from.\n\n**9.

No apartments or duplexes, etc. The community is focused on specifically traditional suburban architecture.\n4. **Don't post addresses or other easily identifiable information unless it is publicly listed.**\n-->Keep the information about the property you are posting basic and general. However, if the home is listed on a public website you are permitted to post a link to the public listing.\n5. **Direct Images Only, no links please.**\n-->Post correctly cropped, direct images and not links to websites. Image hosting links, such as Imgur, are an exception, but we still prefer a direct image.  Zillow house page, for example, is ok if it directly links to the photos and such.\n6. **No Spam**\n-->No posting an excessive amount in a row on the same day or posting the same comment on several posts at once.  We have seen it, we just didn't react to it.  Please understand that.\n7. **No Screenshots**\n-->Crop your photos correctly.\n8. **Thursday is special.

Diese Entwicklung muss umgehend gestoppt werden. Krankenhäuser retten Leben. Wir brauchen sie in Krisenzeiten und im Alltag.

Dies soll garantieren, dass jeder alles verstehen kann. Ausnahmen sind z.B. Memes, die beinhalten, dass man manche Dinge nicht versteht.\n\n**3. Seid freundlich, locker und respektvoll**\n\nWir wollen, dass sich im Idealfall eine Community durch diese Community entwickelt.

It takes both content and layout to make something a guide. The layout or structure of a guide must be that so, when someone is trying to find/reference information from the guide, they can do so logically or simply. If someone has to visually bop around your guide to find what they are looking for, the guide does not pass the layout test. On top of that not all guides are created equal, many technically qualify as guides, but lack substance. Guides are typically laid out in a grid configuration of some sort or sectioned into multiple tables by a category or step of a process. Flow charts and step-by-step guides are considered guides, so are visual references that line up different types of something next to one another other.\n\nDefining An Infographic\n-\nAn infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides.\n\n**Remembering That Sometimes It's Grey** These are the considerations the mod team use when they feel it is appropriate to remove posts. If you have questions message us, if you thinka post is not a good one downvote it.\n\nIf you know the source of your guide, post it in the comments so people can know the true heros!\n\nMany of you might have whole folders of guides, but they are all on similar topics. Please help keep the sub diverse by not saturating the sub with one topic. If you do we may remove some of your posts in the interest of keeping a wide array of topics.\n\nLastly always check the comments for guides. Moderators are not experts in everything we do not always moderate for accuracy though there are often one or two people wearing their smarty pants in the comments.\n\nRules\n-\n**Direct links to images**\nOnly direct links to images of type .png, jpg, and .jpeg are allowed\n\n**Infographics will be removed**\nAn infographic is more educational in layout and content, finding something specific on an infographic is not as easy because it is designed to inform through more narrative structures. If your guide is more of a visual essay than a structured table or list, then chances are that is an infographic. Sometimes infographics can masquerade as how-to guides.\n\n**Nonserious/Comedy Guides Will Be Removed**\n\n**Dangerous/Harmful/Hurtful/Destructive Guides** Guides depicting harmful, dangerous, or destructive content will be removed. This includes guides describing the creation of dangerous items/materials and/or guides that are designed with the purpose to harm or hurt others do not fit the culture of this community and will be removed.\n\n","icon":"https://lemmy.ca/pictrs/image/ed7bd7d8-a25a-496b-8c3c-3715ec09b129.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":835,"community_id":33729,"subscribers":370,"posts":21,"comments":20,"published":"2023-06-11T13:52:07.383799","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":10,"users_active_month":10,"users_active_half_year":10,"hot_rank":7},"time":1687149369096,"score":311910},{"baseurl":"lemmy.fmhy.ml","url":"https://lemmy.fmhy.ml/c/bpo","name":"bpo","title":"Black Pearl Origin","desc":null,"icon":"https://lemmy.fmhy.ml/pictrs/image/78c538d0-b6f3-4dd7-bb3d-848e7dffb939.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":310,"community_id":501,"subscribers":9,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-11T02:29:28.907739","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687153680046,"score":7011},{"baseurl":"lemmy.radio","url":"https://lemmy.radio/c/lemmy","name":"lemmy","title":"Lemmy talk","desc":"Chat/Questions about our Lemmy instance or Lemmy in general.","icon":"https://lemmy.radio/pictrs/image/8babff6c-70d6-4b6d-8a37-366763a4d4fc.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":11,"community_id":12,"subscribers":9,"posts":6,"comments":10,"published":"2023-06-12T20:41:46.477901","users_active_day":2,"users_active_week":3,"users_active_month":3,"users_active_half_year":3,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687149725745,"score":2286},{"baseurl":"iusearchlinux.fyi","url":"https://iusearchlinux.fyi/c/teardrop_trailers","name":"teardrop_trailers","title":"Teardrop and tiny trailers ","desc":"A community for all your teardrop and tiny trailer interests","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":545,"community_id":1371,"subscribers":3,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-15T20:12:52.550374","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":2},"time":1687153665128,"score":2334},{"baseurl":"lemmy.ca","url":"https://lemmy.ca/c/fantasyfootball","name":"fantasyfootball","title":"Fantasy Football","desc":"All things Fantasy Football","icon":"https://lemmy.ca/pictrs/image/dbba31a2-0294-4f24-b49e-3274ec119139.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1470,"community_id":35656,"subscribers":2,"posts":1,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-14T20:21:26.604140","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":73},"time":1687149369069,"score":1686},{"baseurl":"lemmygrad.ml","url":"https://lemmygrad.ml/c/leftistinfighting","name":"leftistinfighting","title":"Leftist Infighting: A community dedicated to allowing leftists to vent their frustrations","desc":"The purpose of this community is sort of a \"work out your frustrations by letting it all out\" where different leftist tendencies can vent their frustrations with one another and more assertively and directly challenge one another.

It is a good read and gives you insight into the tradition. You can find the original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sauna/comments/wls9sm/finnish_sauna_and_why_are_we_so_defencive_about_it/), or you can read the slightly shortened version below.\n\n**What's a sauna?**\n\nLike most of you already know the word sauna comes from Finnish. We have had saunas here for thousands of years and according to wikipedia, the oldest are from around 1500-900 BC. It was an important building and in the old days people have even given birth in saunas, as late as the first half of the 1900s. Probably since it was a nice separate building with access to warm water. In 2020 [Finnish sauna was added to UNESCO’s Cultural Heritage List](https://unric.org/en/finnish-sauna-added-to-unescos-cultural-heritage-list/). Check the link out for more interesting information but I want to again highlight that. It really shows how important it is in our culture.\n\nNowadays pretty much everyone in Finland has access to a sauna of some sort. Houses have them, many apartments, like mine, have one and apartment buildings can have a common sauna where you can rent your private hour and they can have a certain period during which anyone can just go there. And of course summer cottages have a sauna and the ones next to a lake are kind of the perfect image of a Finnish sauna. Plus all the public saunas in swimming halls, gyms, hotels etc. Temperature in a sauna can vary but usually it's between 80-120 °C (176-248 F). Mine is oddly low at 60°C but that is because the ceramic stones that I now use really change the way the löyly (water thrown on the stones on the heater to generate steam) hits you. It is softer and accumulates well instead of being kind of short burst of heat that dissipates quickly. I've tried at 80 and I was out of there really quick unlike with more common stones. One reason why staring at a thermometer doesn't make sense. Just try it and see what feels good. And you other Finns, that 60 really sounds low but I tell you, I'm getting out of there after I guess something like 10-15 minutes with red skin so it really works.\n\nWood or electric? Both work. Wood heated ones are usually considered to be the best. You get a nicer löyly there but they aren't really an option in an apartment house. An electric heater that has a lot of stones can actually give a very similar löyly. I just experienced one that I believe had 500 kg of stone. Same with a small electric heater (20 kg) with the ceramic stones. All of those options are great for a sauna. As long as there are proper stones and you can freely throw water to get the löyly you want. Löyly is the essential thing here. Without it, you can't really call it a Finnish sauna and that is why Finns do not really consider IR boxes to be saunas. This ties to one of the topics often argued: do you need a drain? Yes you do. Not necessarily inside the sauna if you have the bathroom outside. Mine has only a shower drain but the sauna floor is tilted so that any water flows directly there. It's also good for washing the sauna.\n\nBench heights are often discussed here but why does it matter? Because heat rises. The lower part of a sauna is cold and you want to get your head close to the ceiling and your feet high enough to not feel cold. The \"feet at the stone level\" is just a nice helper for a basic heater. For tower shaped ones you probably want to find out the exact height. This is also why you need to have proper air flow in the sauna. You want the hot air and fresh air mixed, you want the moisture to leave after you're done and you don't want the heat escaping due to wrongly implemented ventilation. Don't ask me about construction things, I don't know anything about that. I just know mine was built according to Finnish standards and my apartment won't rot if I use it.\n\n**What we do in a sauna?**\n\nFor me sauna is a place to wash since I don't often take a shower without heating the sauna. Yep, I heat it up often. It's also a place to relax and to socialize. I sometimes have friends visiting and we heat it up, chat in there and have a beer on the balcony. It's a place where you can forget about your phone, social media and all that and just focus on your thoughts, happy or sad, or have deep discussions with your friends. There is something about the atmosphere that makes people open up in a sauna and talk about more private things. I know I'm not the only one. I've heard many people say that sauna is the place where they talk about the deep stuff with friends.\n\nThe idea of maxing health benefits, that have been found in recent studies, is just not something we Finns really understand. Why? Because we've been to saunas for many other reasons throughout our lives. It's so integral part of my everyday life that making it a spa treatment or some healthy excercise just doesn't fit my understanding of saunas. But if you want to pursue those health benefits, a high enough heat and a strong enough löyly is what you want because that is how we have gone to saunas and gained the benefits that were seen in the studies. Do you need to measure your heart beat and have exact temperature? No. You'll feel your heart bumping and you'll feel the need to get out sooner or later. Staring at heart beat or timers takes away from one of the important points: just sit and relax and let your mind wonder. Löyly transfers additional heat from the boiling water to your body and gets your heart beating fast. That's also good to remember if you actually hunt for health benefits. Sitting in a luke warm cabin with no löyly for a certain time is definitely not the same thing that gave Finns health benefits.\n\n**Saunalike concepts in other cultures and countries**\n\nSure, there are similar things in many other cultures. They are *not* inferior to sauna, they are just a different thing. They have their own cultural backgrounds and reasons to exist. \"This is not a sauna.\" is what you often see written here but that is not meant as an insult that your heated cabin sucks. It just means that we Finns do not really appreciate it if the thing in question is called a sauna, because it does not meet the definition of what we have considered a sauna for thousands of years. Finland is a rather remote and small/unknown country and one of the things people know about us is sauna. That is why many of us would like to keep the image of sauna as correct and original as possible.","icon":"https://r-sauna.fi/pictrs/image/75f4e477-7911-4089-b077-ee0f2c2ead40.png","banner":"https://r-sauna.fi/pictrs/image/035acf99-4f1f-445d-ba28-a689c215f6e4.png","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":2,"community_id":3,"subscribers":27,"posts":7,"comments":11,"published":"2023-06-08T21:09:43.702149","users_active_day":4,"users_active_week":12,"users_active_month":12,"users_active_half_year":12,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687149073773,"score":459},{"baseurl":"mylem.my","url":"https://mylem.my/c/ai_anime_wallpapers","name":"ai_anime_wallpapers","title":"booba","desc":"animes but wallpapers only but made by people with no art skill only","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":4,"community_id":5,"subscribers":1,"posts":14,"comments":1,"published":"2023-06-13T02:59:14.051060","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":2,"users_active_month":2,"users_active_half_year":2},"time":1687149722089,"score":17},{"baseurl":"feddit.de","url":"https://feddit.de/c/zurich","name":"zurich","title":"Zürich","desc":null,"icon":"https://feddit.de/pictrs/image/0a53e578-cdf8-4723-8319-ffa888a2059b.png","banner":"https://feddit.de/pictrs/image/e316909a-d31c-4c90-8362-412152ea36fd.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1490,"community_id":48315,"subscribers":9,"posts":2,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-11T16:34:15.392174","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":2,"users_active_month":2,"users_active_half_year":2,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687153678650,"score":7839},{"baseurl":"lemmy.ca","url":"https://lemmy.ca/c/londonontario","name":"londonontario","title":"London Ontario","desc":"Community for London Ontario","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":929,"community_id":34027,"subscribers":10,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-12T03:18:27.315812","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":3},"time":1687149369113,"score":8430},{"baseurl":"exploding-heads.com","url":"https://exploding-heads.com/c/books","name":"books","title":"Book Club","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":433,"community_id":2609,"subscribers":4,"posts":4,"comments":0,"published":"2022-12-24T08:48:59.203523","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1},"time":1687149135248,"score":580},{"baseurl":"vlemmy.net","url":"https://vlemmy.net/c/india","name":"india","title":"India","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":715,"community_id":1350,"subscribers":3,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-15T13:24:10.498589","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":10},"time":1687149186268,"score":2409},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/cumhaters","name":"cumhaters","title":"Cum Haters","desc":"Women who really don't look like they want to take that facial.","icon":"https://lemmynsfw.com/pictrs/image/03093ab7-22f6-416c-b9b8-1995170a1729.jpeg","banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":449,"community_id":522,"subscribers":302,"posts":30,"comments":3,"published":"2023-06-13T13:24:30.784882","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":5,"users_active_month":5,"users_active_half_year":5,"hot_rank":3},"time":1687150554864,"score":117176},{"baseurl":"lemmy.ca","url":"https://lemmy.ca/c/canadianyarnexchange","name":"canadianyarnexchange","title":"The Great Canadian Yarn Exchange","desc":"A place to sell, exchange and give away that most seductive of addictions.

Reposts will be removed on sight.\n\n6. Fan project limitations.\nThe limit goes as follows: If your project is a stage based project, then you must upload all stages in 1 singular post. NO INDIVIDUAL STAGE UPLOADS. This is the same case with tracks or other albums if they're part of an album or other larger scale project. If you need to post tracks or albums more frequently, you may post them to c/caretakerfanprojects.\n\n7.

The company was founded by Cornell computer scientists, who partnered with Wall Street veterans and early Web3 leaders to execute a promising vision for redefining the way people build and use open, permissionless networks. Ava Labs is redefining the way people create value with Web3.\n\n[Avalanche](https://avax.network/) is a smart contracts platform built to scale infinitely and finalize transactions in under a second. Its novel consensus protocol, Subnet infrastructure, and HyperSDK toolkit enable businesses to easily launch powerful, custom blockchain solutions. Build anything you want, any way you want, on the eco-friendly blockchain designed for both Web3 devs and businesses.\n\n[AVAX](https://avax.network/individuals) is the native token of the Avalanche platform, used for gas fees and for staking to validate transactions and secure the network. AVAX provides a basic unit of account for the network and between Subnets, allowing holders to play Web3 games, mint NFTs, deploy and fund dApps, and much more.\n\n[Avalanche Explorer](https://explorer.avax.network/) is an analytics tool that allows people to search the Avalanche platform and ecosystem, providing data on Subnets, blocks, transactions, addresses, and other platform activities. Visualize everything in the Avalanche ecosystem.\n\n[Avalanche Wallet](https://wallet.avax.network/) is a simple, secure, self-custody wallet for Avalanche assets.\n\n[Core](https://core.app/) is your free, all-in-one crypto command center for Avalanche dApps, NFTs, bridges, Subnets, L2s, and more. Core supports Avalanche, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all EVM-compatible blockchains.\n\n[Subnets](https://docs.avax.network/subnets) empower anyone to build custom, app-specific blockchains optimized to fit all of your needs. Subnets are seamlessly interoperable, can use your native protocol token for gas fees, and allow Avalanche to scale infinitely. Minimize your transaction costs and maximize your user experience.\n","icon":"https://diggit.xyz/pictrs/image/7b46f5d9-e5db-4f76-a637-173dfa101876.png","banner":"https://diggit.xyz/pictrs/image/73c86abe-6cbe-4201-8923-4d93793bfed9.png","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":14,"community_id":16,"subscribers":1,"posts":2,"comments":1,"published":"2023-06-12T18:18:07.602928","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":2,"users_active_month":2,"users_active_half_year":2},"time":1687149201792,"score":665},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/goddesses","name":"goddesses","title":"goddesses","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":853,"community_id":1332,"subscribers":121,"posts":8,"comments":1,"published":"2023-06-16T14:40:23.947834","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":2,"users_active_month":2,"users_active_half_year":2,"hot_rank":12},"time":1687150554657,"score":46948},{"baseurl":"feddit.uk","url":"https://feddit.uk/c/northumberland","name":"northumberland","title":"Northumberland","desc":"A place where you can talk about various things about Northumberland.

The aim of the sub-reddit is to bring the Indian left together to improve communications, fight against communalism(religious sectarianism in the subcontinent), fascism and petty sectarianism that consistently harms us.\n\n# Rules\n- First and foremost we have to remember that - left politics is a disciplined practice which is driven by principles that are based on well-established ideological tendency. So we cannot post, or comment, anything which works against the united Left forces in India. If you have anything against any of the Left parties, then kindly follow the Party principles of internal democracy and work to solve the issues with them, instead of slandering any of the parties.\n- This subreddit is not connected to any organisation, financially. This is a digital platform run by supporters of Left politics voluntarily.\n- On the occurrence of any natural or social disasters, contact the moderators seeking permission for posting links/details for financial assistance. If the moderators decide it is appropriate, they will make an announcement as soon as possible.\n- We don't support/promote plagiarism. If you're posting something that is not your own creation kindly mention the creator (in the title or in the comment).\n- If you're posting a news please make sure they aren't fake. It's upto the original post-maker to verify the sources and credibility of the news. If it comes to the moderators' notice, the post-maker shall be banned temporarily for 7 days, at first, and permanently on repetition of the same offence.\n- Don't use slurs. Be decent while arguing with your fellow comrades. We have a zero-tolerance policy in this regard. Don't bring down arguments to petty fights. Be rational while arguing. If you are arguing and want to disprove someone, use acceptable sources instead of abusing.\n- Keep posts relevant to left politics. Anything else shall be removed.\n- We are anti-hate. Any post that promotes or supports hate against any other group shall be removed. This includes, but is not limited to, hate against the Bahujans, the Minority religious groups, any gender, and people of different region. Criticism of religions and idealistic philosophical trends are permitted only if they are not promoting hate against the members/followers.\n- Left politics is going through tough times due to quite some reasons. So instead of indulging in petty infights, try and build a positive image of the Party you are are from or the Party you support. If you're knowledgeable about some thing, help others by sharing that knowledge. Anti-Communism (and anti-Leftism) is a dominant political trend in India and the anti-left rhetorics that are common in the political rallies of the Rightists and the Centrists are just a vehicle of anti-Leftism as a whole. So if you come to see some false things are spread against any Party or Party leader, indulge in counter propaganda. Don't let falsifiers and their agents gain an upper-hand by any chance.\n- Before making a post or cross-posting, make sure it hasn't been posted before. There should be a 6-month gap (the time after which posts become archived) between a repetition.\n- No religious posts are allowed.\n- Do not share any news item covered by the bourgeois press pertaining to elections (opinion polls and probable candidate list, for example) or Party news. For the latter, stick to Party papers or digital outlets of the Party (official Twitter handle, Facebook page or YouTube channel). Bourgeois press never helps the Left. Only it does is promoting myths.\n- If you want to give any feedback about this sub-Reddit please contact the mods. We will discuss and think about the inputs and decide collectively.\n- Report to mods anything you see unworthy of this group (lies, myths, rumours about Parties, leaders).","icon":"https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/gPT8L1E42s.jpg","banner":"https://lemmygrad.ml/pictrs/image/ggrMU5stDG.png","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":489,"community_id":9692,"subscribers":19,"posts":3,"comments":0,"published":"2021-09-19T11:34:10.434602","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149383576,"score":-7239},{"baseurl":"haynerds.com","url":"https://haynerds.com/c/art","name":"art","title":"Art","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":11,"community_id":12,"subscribers":1,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-08T18:52:00.178612","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0},"time":1687148823180,"score":14},{"baseurl":"lemm.ee","url":"https://lemm.ee/c/chairsunderwater","name":"chairsunderwater","title":"Chairs Underwater","desc":"A safe space for lovers of aquatic chairs.","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":263,"community_id":310,"subscribers":14,"posts":2,"comments":3,"published":"2023-06-10T18:34:10.673035","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":3,"users_active_half_year":3,"hot_rank":0,"hot_rank_updated":"2023-06-19T04:04:18.861014"},"time":1687149189379,"score":11606},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/tanlineshentai","name":"tanlineshentai","title":"Tanlines Hentai","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":412,"community_id":464,"subscribers":160,"posts":10,"comments":3,"published":"2023-06-13T09:54:08.825877","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":4,"users_active_month":4,"users_active_half_year":4,"hot_rank":3},"time":1687150554838,"score":62080},{"baseurl":"sh.itjust.works","url":"https://sh.itjust.works/c/shitpostemblem","name":"shitpostemblem","title":"Shit Post Emblem","desc":"Fire Emblem memes and shitposts.\nNo porn, bigotry, and dodgetanking.

- Health Benefits ","desc":"Chromotherapy is a centuries-old concept. The history of color medicine is as old as that of any other medicine. \n\nPhototherapy (light therapy) was practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece, China and India. The Egyptians utilized sunlight as well as color for healing (4). Color has been investigated as medicine since 2000 BC (5). People of that era were certainly unaware of the scientific facts of colors as medicine, but they certainly had faith in healing with colors.\n\n- Bright white full-spectrum light is also now being used in the treatment of cancers, SAD (seasonal affective disorder, so-called winter depression), anorexia, bulimia nervosa, insomnia, jetlag, shift working, alcohol and drug dependency, and to reduce overall levels of medication.\n- Blue light found to be successful in the treatment of neonatal jaundice has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis\n- Blue light is also used in healing injured tissue and preventing scar tissue, as well as for burns and lung conditions\n- Blue light in the treatment of a wide variety of psychological problems, including addictions, eating disorders and depression.\n- Red light has been shown to be effective in the treatment of cancer and constipation and in healing wounds.\n- Pink light has a tranquilizing and calming effect within minutes of exposure. It suppresses hostile, aggressive and anxious behavior.\n\nChromotherapy is now used to improve the performance of athletes: \n- red light appears to help athletes who need short, quick bursts of energy, \n- blue light assists in performances requiring a steadier energy output.","icon":"https://exploding-heads.com/pictrs/image/4a243729-1a2c-414a-9be2-0b8e471c47f9.jpeg","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":177,"community_id":363,"subscribers":2,"posts":2,"comments":0,"published":"2022-05-08T14:05:07.415367","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1},"time":1687149135230,"score":290},{"baseurl":"sh.itjust.works","url":"https://sh.itjust.works/c/apple","name":"apple","title":"Apple","desc":"Apple Computers and all related news/info/questions","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":953,"community_id":2098,"subscribers":35,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-12T03:04:52.699246","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":18},"time":1687149210545,"score":29785},{"baseurl":"yiffit.net","url":"https://yiffit.net/c/meta","name":"meta","title":"Meta & Announcements","desc":null,"icon":"https://yiffit.net/pictrs/image/e2399192-3fe9-47eb-b463-91b58501b81f.png","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":3,"community_id":4,"subscribers":110,"posts":27,"comments":117,"published":"2023-06-07T23:26:45.566705","users_active_day":9,"users_active_week":28,"users_active_month":29,"users_active_half_year":29,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149236907,"score":81510},{"baseurl":"exploding-heads.com","url":"https://exploding-heads.com/c/genocide","name":"genocide","title":"Genocide","desc":"Still it goes on.\nShame on all of us.","icon":"https://exploding-heads.com/pictrs/image/fe4720c0-f651-4997-b971-49cbd17dde2d.jpeg","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":22,"community_id":23,"subscribers":5,"posts":46,"comments":0,"published":"2022-03-03T01:11:20.843849","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1},"time":1687149135251,"score":725},{"baseurl":"bakchodi.org","url":"https://bakchodi.org/c/art","name":"art","title":"Art","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":24,"community_id":25,"subscribers":266,"posts":29,"comments":57,"published":"2022-03-29T04:20:32.133748","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":3,"users_active_month":3,"users_active_half_year":5},"time":1687149744768,"score":-532},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/professional","name":"professional","title":"Professional Shoots","desc":"Pictures dedicated to professional shoots (Playboy type)","icon":"https://lemmynsfw.com/pictrs/image/affaecc9-7da2-4d25-8633-d688b2a3af7b.png","banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":44,"community_id":45,"subscribers":427,"posts":4,"comments":1,"published":"2023-06-11T20:10:05.290482","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":3,"users_active_half_year":3,"hot_rank":2},"time":1687150555109,"score":165676},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/legalteens","name":"legalteens","title":"Legal Teens","desc":"Alternative to r/legalteens.

When the accursed tsarist monarchy was living its last days it tried to incite ignorant workers and peasants against the Jews. The tsarist police, in alliance with the landowners and the capitalists, organised pogroms against the Jews. The landowners and capitalists tried to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants who were tortured by want against the Jews. In other countries, too, we often see the capitalists fomenting hatred against the Jews in order to blind the workers, to divert their attention from the real enemy of the working people, capital. Hatred towards the Jews persists only in those countries where slavery to the landowners and capitalists has created abysmal ignorance among the workers and peasants. Only the most ignorant and downtrodden people can believe the lies and slander that are spread about the Jews. This is a survival of ancient feudal times, when the priests burned heretics at the stake, when the peasants lived in slavery, and when the people were crushed and inarticulate. This ancient, feudal ignorance is passing away; the eyes of the people are being opened.\n\nIt is not the Jews who are the enemies of the working people. The enemies of the workers are the capitalists of all countries. Among the Jews there are working people, and they form the majority. They are our brothers, who, like us, are oppressed by capital; they are our comrades in the struggle for socialism. Among the Jews there are kulaks, exploiters and capitalists, just as there are among the Russians, and among people of all nations. The capitalists strive to sow and foment hatred between workers of different faiths, different nations and different races. Those who do not work are kept in power by the power and strength of capital. Rich Jews, like rich Russians, and the rich in all countries, are in alliance to oppress, crush, rob and disunite the workers.\n\nShame on accursed tsarism which tortured and persecuted the Jews. Shame on those who foment hatred towards the Jews, who foment hatred towards other nations.\n\nLong live the fraternal trust and fighting alliance of the workers of all nations in the struggle to overthrow capital.\" - V.

More specifically, DeFi consists of smart contracts, which, in turn, power decentralized applications (DApps) and protocols. \n\nMany of the initial DeFi applications were built on Ethereum, and the majority of the ecosystem’s total value locked (TVL) remains concentrated there. \n\nHere are some of the ways people are engaging with DeFi today: \n- Lending: Lend out your crypto and earn interest and rewards every minute - not once per month.\n- Getting a loan: Obtain a loan instantly without filling in paperwork, including extremely short-term “flash loans” that traditional financial institutions don’t offer.\n- Trading: Make peer-to-peer trades of certain crypto assets — as if you could buy and sell stocks without any kind of brokerage.\n- Saving for the future: Put some of your crypto into savings account alternatives and earn better interest rates than you’d typically get from a bank. \n- Buying derivatives: Make long or short bets on certain assets. Think of these as the crypto version of stock options or futures contracts. \n\n**WARNING:**\nInvesting in NFTs, cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings (“ICOs”) is highly risky and speculative, and these links and discussions are not recommendations by Exploding Heads or the writer to invest in NFTs, cryptocurrencies or other ICOs. \n\nSince each individual's situation is unique, a qualified professional should always be consulted before making any financial decisions.

It can be used more specifically to refer to all of the species in one region or ecosystem. Biodiversity refers to every living thing, including plants, bacteria, animals, and humans. Scientists have estimated that there are around 8.7 million species of plants and animals in existence. However, only around 1.2 million species have been identified and described so far, most of which are insects. This means that millions of other organisms remain a complete mystery.\n>\n>Over generations, all of the species that are currently alive today have evolved unique traits that make them distinct from other species. These differences are what scientists use to tell one species from another. Organisms that have evolved to be so different from one another that they can no longer reproduce with each other are considered different species. All organisms that can reproduce with each other fall into one species. [Read more...](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/biodiversity/)\n\n**Rules**\n\n1. Don't throw mud.

Questions over blame\n2. Humility over pride\n3. Wisdom over dogma\n4. Actions over image\n\n**Rules (expansions on the guidelines):**\n\n1. Mistakes should be learning experiences when possible.\n    * Do not attack comrades displaying vulnerability for what they acknowledge are mistakes.\n    * If you see good-faith behavior that's toxic, do your best to explain why it's toxic.\n    * If you don't have the energy to engage, report and move on.\n    * This includes past mistakes. If you've overcome extreme reactionary behavior, we'd love to know how.\n    * A widened range of acceptable discussion means a greater need for sensitivity and patience for your comrades.\n    * Examples:\n        * \"This is reactionary. Here's why.\"\n        * \"I know that {reality}, but I feel like {toxicity}\"\n        * \"I don't understand why this is reactionary, but it feels like it {spoilered details}\"\n2. You are not entitled to the emotional labor of others.\n    * Constantly info-dumping and letting us sort through your psyche is not healthy for any of us.\n    * If you feel a criticism of you is unfair, do not lash out.\n    * If you can't engage self-critically, delete your post.\n    * If you don't know how to phrase why it's unfair, say so.\n3. No singular masculine ideal.\n    * This includes promoting gender-neutral traits like \"courage\" or \"integrity\" as \"manly\".\n    * Suggestions for an individual to replace a toxic ideal is fine.\n    * Don't reinforce the idea the fulfillment requires masculinity.\n    * This also includes tendency struggle-sessions.\n4. No lifestyle content.\n    * Post the picture of your new grill in [!food](/c/food) (feminine people like grills too smh my head).\n    * Post the picture of the fish you caught in !sports (feminine people like fish too smdh my damn head).\n    * At best, stuff like this is off-topic. At worst, it's reinforcing genders norms..\n    * If you're not trying to be seen as masculine for your lifestyle content, it's irrelevant to this comm. If you are trying to be seen as masculine, let's have a discussion about why these things are seen as masculine.\n\n**Resources:**\n\n* [What is toxic masculinity?](https://xyonline.net/content/toxic-masculinity-primer-and-commentary)\n\n*The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and Love by Bell Hooks","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":42,"community_id":44,"subscribers":7787,"posts":136,"comments":2445,"published":"2020-09-15T18:57:07.109633","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":30,"users_active_half_year":162},"time":1687149307500,"score":23361},{"baseurl":"lemmy.x01.ninja","url":"https://lemmy.x01.ninja/c/main","name":"main","title":"The Default Community","desc":"The Default Community","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1,"community_id":2,"subscribers":0,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-13T19:30:18.005752","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0},"time":1687149168646,"score":0},{"baseurl":"pathfinder.social","url":"https://pathfinder.social/c/pf1adventure","name":"pf1adventure","title":"Pathfinder 1e Official Adventures","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":18,"community_id":19,"subscribers":6,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-04T17:07:26.633944","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0},"time":1687149147705,"score":4260},{"baseurl":"sh.itjust.works","url":"https://sh.itjust.works/c/simracingstewards","name":"simracingstewards","title":"Sim Racing Stewards","desc":"A good old whodunnit with a wholesome lesson at the end of every post.","icon":"https://sh.itjust.works/pictrs/image/0150ee9c-d562-411c-a53f-dbd259a0bd99.jpeg","banner":"https://sh.itjust.works/pictrs/image/d680d752-e56d-4169-9201-053d6689f9d4.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":2099,"community_id":5431,"subscribers":2,"posts":1,"comments":1,"published":"2023-06-15T08:07:30.770519","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":1728},"time":1687149210396,"score":1702},{"baseurl":"exploding-heads.com","url":"https://exploding-heads.com/c/bitfinex","name":"bitfinex","title":"Crypto - Bitfinex","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":226,"community_id":943,"subscribers":3,"posts":5,"comments":0,"published":"2022-07-12T15:47:46.626795","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1},"time":1687149135322,"score":435},{"baseurl":"latte.isnot.coffee","url":"https://latte.isnot.coffee/c/bali","name":"bali","title":"Bali","desc":null,"icon":"https://latte.isnot.coffee/pictrs/image/f6c34965-e391-44ba-aa83-fcab75167055.jpeg","banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":68,"community_id":141,"subscribers":2,"posts":3,"comments":5,"published":"2023-06-12T01:29:32.735239","users_active_day":3,"users_active_week":4,"users_active_month":4,"users_active_half_year":4,"hot_rank":0},"time":1687149165205,"score":1566},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/transhentai","name":"transhentai","title":"TransHentai","desc":"Hentai featuring non-cis characters\n\nRules\n- 1: Content must include a non-cis character.\n- 2: Content/Comments must be transpositive.\n- 3: Don't be a bigot.\n- 4: Don't kinkshame\n- 5: No RPing or making \"Personals\"\n- 6: Source your posts","icon":"https://lemmynsfw.com/pictrs/image/ac429485-7dd0-4636-95f6-212ffaf9cfc5.png","banner":"https://lemmynsfw.com/pictrs/image/f7a54eab-a520-4772-b905-07baf5f14e49.png","nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":911,"community_id":1501,"subscribers":50,"posts":12,"comments":2,"published":"2023-06-17T05:53:17.631662","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":3,"users_active_month":3,"users_active_half_year":3,"hot_rank":16},"time":1687150554650,"score":19400},{"baseurl":"lemm.ee","url":"https://lemm.ee/c/youtubedl","name":"youtubedl","title":"youtube-dl","desc":"youtube-dl and the yt-dlp fork are a command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com, as well as many other sites.

I’m hoping that by consolidating we can get the community active before niches break out.\n\n## Rules\n - Standard instance rules apply, obviously. \n- Preferably GIFS \n- OC and promotions fine as long as it’s GIFS \n- REDGIFS seems to work best. Imgur and reddit not so much. https://catbox.moe/ is also being suggested on Lemmy. I haven’t really tested that because I don’t upload porn or really anything.\n- Subs that I’m drawing from r/nsfw_gifs, r/NSFWGIFS, r/porninfifteenseconds, r/porninaminute, r/extramile, and more \n\n\nI don’t want to do this, so if some porn enthusiasts want to take over that’d be great.

Bigotry towards non-binary people is transphobia. Truscum rhetoric is also bigotry. You getting punished for your hateful opinion, however, is not bigotry.*\n\n##### 2.) **No Spam**\n \n  • *This includes both advertising and breaking your or my Lemmy instance's rules, such as vote manipulation or brigading.*\n\n##### 3.) **Posts must have something to do with being trans, or about trans experiences**\n \n  • *Try to stay away from negative political events too. You can joke about it, but bringing attention to something bad happening in the world might take someone out of their comfort zone— this is an escape from the constant news cycle for some.*\n\n##### 4.) **No Selfies or Character Creations**\n \n   • *Selfies are not memes! This is not a community for selfies. Picrews and other character creations such as Sims and Mii's are considered bandwagoning, and perhaps can be a part of a different community.*\n\n##### 5.) **SFW-only**\n  \n • *This is an all ages community, so we prefer it if you take the NSFW stuff to one of the more adult oriented communities. Note: nudity is not allowed, we want everybody to be comfortable here.*\n\n##### 6.) **Submissions must be a meme or they will be removed**\n\n##### 7.) **Swearing is fine, but slurs are not**\n\n • *We want everybody to feel safe and comfortable here, so even if you want to reclaim a pejorative word that applies to you— we ask that you don't, as this is a light-hearted community and others stumbling across your post might feel unsafe.*\n\n##### 8.) **Embedded submissions should only link to trusted image sharing sites, no IP grabbers or link shorteners**\n\n##### 9.) **Use but don't misuse the report button**\n  \n • *If something breaks these rules, or this Lemmy instance's rules, please report it.*\n\n##### 10.) **Please do not link to any terf, racist, or any other hate communities or forums**\n \n• *Bigots like those do not deserve any attention. Any post or comment linking to a hate community or forum will be removed*\n\n\n##### 11.) **Don't be a jerk nor a troll**\n  \n   • *Be nice, and don't create social chaos. That's it. Pretty simple, huh?*\n\n\n# Some notes:\n\n###### 1.) **We highly encourage you to use alt text in your posts, so everybody can enjoy this community**\n\n###### 2.) **It would be really nice if you flaired your posts accordingly in the title**\n \n • *For example, a meme about the non-binary experience could have a title like this: \"[NB] Story of my life!\" This will make searching for content much easier.*\n\n###### 3.)

Follow Lemmy TOS and Community Guidelines.\nNon negotiable.  This is the bedrock and mods will make decisions with this always in mind.\n\n2. This community is for ethnic minorities and people of color.  This is a safe space where such people can freely discuss their struggles, insight, and thoughts without fear.  If you are not, we respectfully ask you do not post or comment here.  A future community will be established to allow for racial discussions with a mixed userbase.  However, remember, comments here must still respect Lemmy TOS and Community Guidelines. \n\n3. Irony Racism is still racism.  Racism is bad m'kay?  We will treat irony racism and bad faith racist satire as racism. Will wield the ban hammer accordingly.  \n\n4. No sectarianism: This is an identity channel not a channel for you all to complain about why XYZ isn't the \"one true leftism\".  Take that to another place.\n\n5. Stupidpol is not allowed. Stupidpol is class reductionist. We are an identity community.  Thinking like stupidpol ignores the struggles of the oppressed, their voices, and their need for unique support.  Nothing says oppression more than someone saying that the identity you have is \"not real\" and that if you only thought like them you'd see what your \"real\" identity is.  Mods reserve the right to ban users and content who promote stupidpol, stupidpol memes, and other class reductionist thinking.  \n\nFAQ\n\nI don't look XYZ and/or sometimes I can pass as white so I don't know if I can post here.  Can I?\n- This place is for ethnic minorities and people of color.  This includes those of mixed heritage and those who may be \"white\" but are of an ethnicity that is a minority in their area (i.e. Kurds, etc) If you've experienced oppression due to your identity that is not based on sexual / gender identification, you are welcome here.  \n\n- Moreover, for our American audience, we have people from around the world who are \"white\" but are oppressed due to being a minority in their country.  They are and should be welcomed here.  \n\nWhat can I post?\n- Anything you think is relevant to the mission of this community.  Things will evolve over time.  \n- Topics and things relevant to EM and POC. \n\nSuggested Posts \n- [People of Spice]: Food recipes so others can taste your culture\n- [Theory]: Vid/podcasts/websites discussing issues relevant to identity, anti-imperialism, etc\n- [News]: Vids/podcasts/websites that talk about current events relevant to EM and POC","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":20,"community_id":22,"subscribers":1241,"posts":198,"comments":19976,"published":"2020-07-25T21:58:59.097322","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":2},"time":1687149307560,"score":3723},{"baseurl":"monero.town","url":"https://monero.town/c/wallstreetsilver","name":"wallstreetsilver","title":"wallstreetsilver","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":100,"community_id":101,"subscribers":6,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-13T15:42:17.778705","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":2},"time":1687153652733,"score":4476},{"baseurl":"exploding-heads.com","url":"https://exploding-heads.com/c/freeforumfamily","name":"freeforumfamily","title":"free forum family","desc":"A family, friendly, safe for work room to post about anything.

The occasional dad-joke is fine, but have a clear idea of what constitutes as a low quality or low effort post. Also, please give your posts some sort of context that can be discussed. Single links or opinions with no explanations to them will also be taken down. We have a Meme Board on our Discord server where you can post until heart's content.\n\n**Rule 2: No Controversial Topics-** Discussing topics that can be deemed controversial, such as articles/videos that don't give information but rather are simply subjective opinions, rants and complaints is a no-no. Clearly that's not what people want in this sub. We're here to discuss things that we enjoy about Destiny, and get updates about the game in a hate free environment. Opinion topics are fine, so long as they result in constructive (non-salty) discussions. Mods can remove such posts at their discretion.\n\n**Rule 3: Zero Tolerance on trolls and shitposts-** Any blatantly negative comments or posts, trolling and low-effort posts will result in a permanent ban from the sub. We will not tolerate any form of negative communication here. There will be lowlifes who join just to troll with negative comments and topics. You're encouraged to report such postings ASAP, and they will be dealt with equally ASAP.\n\n**Rule 4: Be nice, or leave!-** Simple as that. Just go with the ol' adage \"If you can't say somethin' nice, don't say anythin' at all.\" (Thanks Thumper). We can't reiterate enough that this is a place for constructively, lively discussion. If such a discussion decays down to arguing and insulting, be it directly or passive aggressively, actions will be take up to and including topic removals and/or permanent bans.\n\n**Rule 5: Please do NOT ask for group ups here!-** Self explanatory. Use one of the other methods to LFG for activities.  Clan Recruitment posts however will allowed as long as you get moderator approval first.\n\n**Rule 6: Flexing Posts-** Flex Posts [aka \"I did (insert activity here) solo, or I finally got (Insert Weapon here)!] are limited to the following activities (must show proof of the flex as well): Endgame PVE Content (clearing or soloing dungeons, master raids/dungeons, raid clear highlights), Obtaining or Gilding Titles.\n\n**Rule 7: Rule for Artists & Content Creators-** Art: If you are not the creator of the artwork being presented, you must credit them in the TOPIC Title and link to their work. Also, No AI generated art will be allowed.\n\n**Rule 8: 9:1 Rule for Content Creators-** For every single post of content from a MONETIZED platform (YouTube, Patreon, Website article that earns ad revenue, etc.), you need to have made 9 QUALITY POSTS (no low effort posts) beforehand, otherwise your content will be REMOVED. This doesn't apply to NON-MONETIZED platforms (DeviantArt, ArtStation, etc.).*","icon":"https://lemmy.ca/pictrs/image/23a31cdc-22ee-4580-8527-2235a27985f2.jpeg","banner":"https://lemmy.ca/pictrs/image/5c90a666-4498-4c9c-9a4d-326d9b652771.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1917,"community_id":37937,"subscribers":3,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-17T17:42:30.474225","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":1728},"time":1687149368946,"score":2529},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/chavgirls","name":"chavgirls","title":"Chav Girls","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":1009,"community_id":1719,"subscribers":9,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-17T20:46:27.694528","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":21},"time":1687150554643,"score":3492},{"baseurl":"discuss.tchncs.de","url":"https://discuss.tchncs.de/c/hotpeppers","name":"hotpeppers","title":"Hot Peppers","desc":"Like r/hotpeppers but on Lemmy.\nShare your peppers, recipes, questions, advice, opinions, etc.","icon":"https://discuss.tchncs.de/pictrs/image/9ff9bb4b-328a-465a-be0d-0844e1fdd981.png","banner":"https://discuss.tchncs.de/pictrs/image/7a90c142-2f77-42fa-b28d-f9089624f54d.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":1074,"community_id":3149,"subscribers":49,"posts":4,"comments":16,"published":"2023-06-15T19:04:12.607854","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":13,"users_active_month":13,"users_active_half_year":13,"hot_rank":7},"time":1687148815085,"score":40621},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/diaperporn","name":"diaperporn","title":"DiaperPorn","desc":"Related Lemmy’s:\n\nABDL- \nhttps://lemmynsfw.com/c/ab_dl\n\nVideos - https://lemmynsfw.com/c/abdl_videos\n\nGirls in diapers - https://lemmynsfw.com/c/girls_in_diapers\n\nDudes in diapers -\n\nhttps://lemmynsfw.com/c/dudesindiapers\n\nMeeting up -\n\nhttps://lemmynsfw.com/c/abdl_asl\n\nDiaper Porn -\n\nhttps://lemmynsfw.com/c/diaperporn\n\nDiapered Trans -\n\nhttps://lemmynsfw.com/c/diapered_trans","icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":true,"counts":{"id":645,"community_id":843,"subscribers":24,"posts":2,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-14T15:41:50.659","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1,"hot_rank":3},"time":1687150554849,"score":9312},{"baseurl":"lemmy.fmhy.ml","url":"https://lemmy.fmhy.ml/c/wrestling","name":"wrestling","title":"wrestling","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":714,"community_id":1540,"subscribers":5,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-13T21:01:51.775399","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":2},"time":1687153680035,"score":3895},{"baseurl":"feddit.ro","url":"https://feddit.ro/c/romemes","name":"romemes","title":"romemes","desc":null,"icon":null,"banner":null,"nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":7,"community_id":8,"subscribers":3,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-14T11:25:35.265872","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":1},"time":1687149612151,"score":1740},{"baseurl":"exploding-heads.com","url":"https://exploding-heads.com/c/hurricanes","name":"hurricanes","title":"Hurricanes","desc":null,"icon":"https://exploding-heads.com/pictrs/image/e8b0ebbf-0f30-4a92-82a9-22b1039361f1.jpeg","banner":"https://exploding-heads.com/pictrs/image/7c10fa96-c9d8-473a-90ea-2cad3ff3c4fa.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":199,"community_id":541,"subscribers":3,"posts":4,"comments":0,"published":"2022-05-30T14:15:26.141317","users_active_day":1,"users_active_week":1,"users_active_month":1,"users_active_half_year":1},"time":1687149135271,"score":435},{"baseurl":"feddit.de","url":"https://feddit.de/c/bodensee","name":"bodensee","title":"bodensee","desc":"The most beautiful place on earth!","icon":null,"banner":"https://feddit.de/pictrs/image/62331557-91e0-4d9d-958e-fe9e0a1f5451.jpeg","nsfw":false,"counts":{"id":2348,"community_id":51985,"subscribers":6,"posts":0,"comments":0,"published":"2023-06-16T09:06:33.464347","users_active_day":0,"users_active_week":0,"users_active_month":0,"users_active_half_year":0,"hot_rank":19},"time":1687153678546,"score":5226},{"baseurl":"lemmynsfw.com","url":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/latinas","name":"latinas","title":"Latinas","desc":"Alternative to r/latinas.

Overly off-topic, political, or hateful debates will be removed, and bans may be issued based on severity. This includes both posts and comments. We reserve the right to remove content or comments that contain discrimination or distasteful content. Be kind and stay on topic.\n\n**Rule 2.** No Reposts: Posts must not have been posted in !DnDMemes before. Reports with direct links to the original post will greatly expedite their removal process. Reposts from other subreddits are allowed, but once a meme is posted to !DnDMemes, it will forever after be considered a repost.\n\n**Rule 3.** Post Style Guide: Posts must be strongly relevant to D&amp;D (or other TTRPGs) and must include an attempt at humor or entertainment. Posts must be legible, understandable for a general audience and have some effort put into them, including titles. Video posts may be up to 3 minutes long, and they must be humorous in nature. Only one meme is allowed per post; posts with multiple images inside of them, such as a collage, will be removed. Posts must not rely solely on the title to relate to D&amp;D.\n\n**Rule 4.** No Advertising: Meme culture is non-profit. No links to stores, fundraising/payment sites, or comments asking for money/followers. Social media handles or website watermarks on original content are acceptable, unless these are monetized, and self promotion of one’s own social media should be limited to once per week. Accounts whose sole purpose are to push products, whether legitimately or fraudulently, will be permanently banned and their content removed.\n\n**Rule 5.** No Piracy: Do not share or request pirated content. No linking, hinting at, or naming hosts of illicit non-SRD D&amp;D content. You are allowed to copy-paste relevant rules or sections from sources, but large blocks of text may be removed.\n\n**Rule 6.** No Beating a Dead Horse: Moderators may step in to issue a 3 month prohibition on certain meme topics and formats. The requirements for placing a topic on hiatus are 1. The topic has been prominent on the front page for at least 3 days or 2. The debate topic is toxic in nature. Certain historically overdone themes or formats may be retired permanently at moderator discretion/per user poll. Please see the current list.\n\n---\n\nThe rules listed above are not exhaustive and decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. Such decisions can be appealed in mod mail, and the mods will do their best to come to a productive resolution. All \"borderline\" mod decisions are the product of informed and objective internal discussion. We welcome feedback on our rules and are always seeking to improve them for better clarity and creating a friendly, social environment here at !DnDMemes.
